# Contributing to the SDK Explorer

If you are interested in this application, we welcome your contributions:

- You can suggest features and improvements in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-sdk-explorer/issues).
- You can clone or fork the repository and implement any features or improvements that you would like to add to the SDK Explorer. Please submit your code for merging into the `develop` branch with a GitHub Pull Request. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> _When creating a new feature, or improvement, it is always preferable to first create a GitHub Issue that describes the idea you intend to work on, so that we all have a chance to discuss it and see how it fits in the bigger picture of the application._
>  
> _Likewise, for bug fixes, make sure there is a GitHub Issue recoded and labeled as `bug`._
> 
> _In your commit messages and pull requests, [reference the issue number](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests). For example `Fixes #7: rest of your commit message here`._
