## Overview


The purpose of the application is to help any user identify the changes that occurred between any two SDK versions, to assist them while they assess the effort required to upgrade their applications to a newer version of the eForms SDK.

The goals of the application are:
1. to make the comparison of SDK versions more intuitive and more practical than the comparison of JSON and XML files.
2. to be as accessible as possible by being self-contained, easy to download and install on any laptop without requiring any special software or infrastructure.
