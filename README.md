## Overview


The purpose of the application is to help any user identify the changes that occurred between any two SDK versions, to assist them while they assess the effort required to upgrade their applications to a newer version of the eForms SDK.

The main goal of the application is to make the comparison of SDK versions more intuitive and more practical than the comparison of JSON and XML files.

## Using the SDK Explorer

The SDK Explorer is integrated in the TED Developer Documentation Portal.

You can access it here: **https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-sdk-explorer/**

> [!NOTE]
> _Initially our intention was to keep the application "as simple as possible" so that it can be downloaded and executed locally in your browser. However, we quickly deviated from our initial intention and decided to integrate the application in the [TED Developer Documentation Portal](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms-sdk-explorer/) instead. This makes accessing the SDK Explorer more convenient for everyone, and allows us to implement it without being restricted by code safety limitations imposed when browsers execute scripts locally on your computer._
